## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent and immutable system for tracking students' learning milestones. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to provide a reliable record of students' achievements that can be accessed by educational institutions, employers, and the students themselves.

## Key Features

- **Student Registration**: Register new students with unique IDs and names.
- **Milestone Tracking**: Record educational milestones achieved by students.
- **Milestone Retrieval**: Retrieve the list of milestones for any registered student.
- **Transparency and Security**: Leveraging blockchain ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and transparent.

### Future Improvements

- *Rating and Feedback System*: After a session ends, students and tutors can rate each other, helping to build trust and improve the quality of the platform.
- *Dispute Resolution*: Implement a mechanism for resolving disputes between tutors and students (e.g., through arbitration or community voting).
- *Extended Functionality*: Add additional features like scheduling, group tutoring, and subscription models.
